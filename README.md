# FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification Projects
This repository contains the projects completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification. The certification involves building five projects that demonstrate proficiency in data analysis using Python.

## Projects
### 1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator:

Analyzes a 3x3 matrix to calculate mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of rows, columns, and elements.
Utilizes NumPy for calculations.

### 2. Demographic Data Analyzer:

Analyzes demographic data from the 1994 Census database using Pandas.
Answers various questions about the dataset, such as the average age of men, percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree, and more.

### 3. Medical Data Visualizer:

Visualizes medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.
Creates charts and graphs to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

### 4. Page View Time Series Visualizer:

Visualizes time series data of page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.
Uses line charts, bar charts, and box plots to understand patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

### 5. Sea Level Predictor:

Analyzes a dataset of global average sea level change since 1880 to predict sea level change through the year 2050.
Uses Pandas to import data and matplotlib to create scatter plots and lines of best fit for prediction.

## How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Each project has its own directory (project1, project2, etc.) containing the necessary files (*.py, *.csv, etc.).
Follow the instructions in each project's README file to run the code and analyze the data.
For development, you can use the provided main.py files to test your code.
