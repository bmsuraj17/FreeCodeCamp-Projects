# Demographic Data Analyzer
This repository contains the projects completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification. The certification involves building five projects that demonstrate proficiency in data analysis using Python.
I analyzed demographic data from the 1994 Census database using Pandas. Dataset contained information such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, native country, and salary.

## Development
The code was written in demographic_data_analyzer.py.
For development, main.py was used to test the code.

## Testing
The unit tests for this project are in test_module.py.
We imported the tests from test_module.py to main.py for convenience.

## How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in an IDE or text editor.
Implement the necessary calculations in demographic_data_analyzer.py to answer the questions provided.
Run main.py to test your implementation.
Ensure all tests pass.
