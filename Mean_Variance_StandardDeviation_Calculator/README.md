# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification where I created five projects. It includes a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses NumPy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

Development
The code for this project is already written in mean_var_std.py.

Testing
The unit tests for this project are in test_module.py. We have imported the tests from test_module.py to main.py for your convenience.
